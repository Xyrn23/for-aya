            <p class="">We‘ve been through a lot, to the point that we parted ways, and I think I made the right the decision. If I didn‘t push you away, you‘ll never find happiness on your own. remember when I told you; “be comfortable on being alone so that a companion is not a necessesity” I am here but not forever. death is inviatable, thus I will love you until my last breath. I want to take this moment to sincerely apoligize for the damage I have done, especially emotionally. I only want what‘s the best for you and just so you know I start planning, designing, and developing this simple gift right after you send that link, I found it cute so I decided to make one but from scratch so I can have a full control to the code, LOL. software dev things hahaha, anyways, I really thought doing it alone is the key but having you by my side gives me an inspiration to keep striving until I become the person I always wanted to be. yes I can do it alone but it is much easier when I am with you. After all this years nasa bff lang pala ang true love HAHAHA! I kid you not but you‘re the only girl who treated me the way I want to be treated, you‘re the only one who stays even on my darkest days, you‘re such an angel, my purple. I love you to the moon and beyond. </p>
